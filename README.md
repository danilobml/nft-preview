## Overview

As a newbie, I am still finding positioning difficult and it took me a while to solve this, in the end I don't know if it's fully right. 

I'd really appreciate f you could take a look and give me feedbacks and tips, pointing out what's wrong and what could be done in a better/easier way. Thank you!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Hover effects with images on the background.
- Better positioning technicques.

### Continued development

I need to practive css flex-box positioning. It still takes me a long time to finish even simple tasks.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) 
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

Both bring great resources. They helped me with hover effects and positioning. I consulted them a couple of times, and don't remember now which helped me with what problem... lol
